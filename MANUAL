Installation Guide

This guide assumes you have a Raspberry Pi installed with Raspbian OS and connected to your network. In the following instructions, replace <ip> with the IP address of the Raspberry (e.g. 192.168.1.99).

This guide further assumes that you don’t have a monitor and keyboard connected to your Raspberry. If you do, a few initial steps will be a little easier.

Step 1 : Download the distribution file to root dir of the Pi

First download the distribution file (ihcserver-0.3.1.tar.gz) to your computer. On a Mac or a linux computer, use a prompt (terminal on mac) to copy the file with scp

scp ihcserver-0.3.1.tar.gz pi@<ip>:.

On Windows, you will need to install an SCP application.

Step 2 : Unpack

Connect to the Raspberry - either from an SSH application or using this command on a prompt.

ssh -l pi <ip>

First check to see that the distribution is where it is supposed to be

ls -l ihc*   

This should show the file you just transferred.

Now, unpack the file with this command

tar xvf ihcserver-0.3.1.tar.gz

This creates an ‘ihc’ subdirectory.

Enter the directory with

cd ihc

Step 3 : Build

Start with this command (which takes a little while to complete)
sudo apt-get update

Follow with this

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev  

(and answer Y to continue)

This will install a required software library

Now the application must be build to create an ‘executable’. Simply type

make

Don’t worry about the warnings displayed in the process.

To check this, type

 ls -l ihcserver

That should list one file - and this is the ihcserver application

Step 4 : Configuration

Write this command

sudo ./ihcserver

It will create a sample configuration file that you will need to edit manually. One option is to use the ‘vi’ editor with this command.

sudo vi /etc/ihcserver.cfg

 (If you don’t know how to use vi, you will need to learn about it before attempting to use it. You may want to use the nano editor instead.)

There are three changes you need to make. Here are the correct lines that matches the installation procedure described so far :

In the first part of the file

"serialDevice" : "/dev/ttyAMA0"

"webroot" : "/home/pi/ihc/webinterface"

and at the bottom

"key" : "HTTP_PORT",
"value" : "8899"

Save the file

The serial port which is used for communication with the IHC Controller can (by default) be used for ‘console’ access to the Raspberry. This must be disabled.
 
sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt

and change the contents to this

Remove this part ‘console=ttyAMA0,115200’  so it becomes

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait

(More recent OS release may look differently)

One more file needs to be changed
sudo vi /etc/inittab
At the end of the file, insert a # to disable more use of the serial port
#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
save the file and reboot with

sudo reboot

Time to connect things

Cut the power to the Raspberry and mount the Linksprite board on the Raspberry.

On the Linksprite, there are ‘A’ and ‘B’ terminals. The IHC Controller has RS485 + and - terminals. ‘A’ should be connected to *+’ and ‘B’ connected to ‘-’ (twisted pair cable recommended)

Start up the Raspberry again and start the ihc server with

cd ihc
sudo ./ihcserver

The should produce some useful output and most likely display some IHC output states.

Now, use a web browser and connect to http://<ip>:8899

Login as admin with ‘123456768’ or as superuser with ‘1234’. Then start by adding modules and naming your inputs and outputs.
