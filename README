IHCServer v0.3

1. Introduction

This software is meant for monitoring and controlling LK (Lauritz Knudsen) A/S's
IHC (Intelligent Home Control) system, or at least the I/Os. It is only tested
with the first Visual controller (the one with the RS-232 port on the front).

It works by monitoring the RS-485 bus that is available on the controller, also
used for the voice modem and other LK IHC peripherals.

The controller issues a command addressed to the PC which gives "permission" to
act. IHCServer then issues commands back to the controller. IHCServer updates
its models of the I/O, alternating between updating INPUT, then OUTPUT on the 
next permission. If there are any pending requests, like setting an output,
IHCServer will issue these, and then continue updating.

2. Software overview

The software consists of 2 main parts, a IHC interface which does the actual
talking to the controller, and the server that can be communicated with via
sockets and JSON encoded packets. For the JSON packet stuff, the cajun JSON
C++ library is used. The library is isolated under the 3rdparty directory, 
along with other code (like base64 stuf) not written by me.
It now also has an integrated webserver to deal with the webinterface, to
avoid apache2 or lighttpd overhead...

The software is written for Linux, and requires pthreads and openssl for 
running. It has been tested on Raspbian with a Raspberry Pi using the
Linksprite RS485 shield.

3. IHC Protocol (AFAIK)

A packet consists of an STX (0x02), an address (fx. 0x1C, for PC), a command 
(like 0x30 for permission), possible data packet depending on the command, 
ETB (0x17) and a CRC that are all the bytes in a packet added up (in 1 byte,
meaning the value should be AND'ed with 0xFF).

Both the output and the input packets data consists of 16 data bytes, where 
each data byte in an output packet represent the state of an output module 
(since an output module has 8 outputs). Thus getting the state of an output 
is as simple as AND'ing the byte value with 0x1 shifted left the output 
number times, eg. BYTEVALUE & (0x1 << OUTPUTNUMBER).

The inputs are the same, except one input module has 16 inputs, thus two bytes
represent a modules inputs state.
