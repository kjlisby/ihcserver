To integrate IHCServer with Domoticz, do the following:

1. Create all the IHC inputs and outputs that you want in Domoticz:
	- Create a dummy switch in Domoticz for each IHC input and output you want 
	  to represent in Domoticz. Do so in Domoticz by:
	  a. Setup -> Hardware
	       Name: IHC
		   Type: Dummy
		   Push the Add button
	  b. For each input or output:
	     Setup -> Hardware
		   Push the "Create virtual sensors" button in the newly created IHC dummy device
		   Using the dialog box and maybe later the edit option in the Switches pane, set
		   up all IHC inputs and outputs to:
		       Name: As described below
			   Type: On/Off
	- Naming is extremely important:
		- Dummy switches representing IHC inputs must be named IHC_I_<module>_<port>, 
		  where <module> is the IHC module number and <port> is the input number on the
		  module.
		- Dummy switches representing IHC outputs must be named IHC_O_<module>_<port>, 
		  where <module> is the IHC module number and <port> is the input number on the
		  module.
		- So for example input module 7, port 11 and output module 2 port 1 are named:
		        IHC_I_7_11 and IHC_O_2_1

2. Add IHCServer scripts to Domoticz:
	- Copy the contents of the directory domoticzscripts from the IHCServer 
	  source code to the scripts directory in your Domoticz installation.
	- Change the following text (both times it appears) in IHCRemoteScript.sh from
	        http://DOMOTICZ-SERVER
	  to the correct address or name of your Domoticz server, such as
			http://192.177.1.97:8081

3. Add scripts to each of the Domoticz switches:
	- In Domoticz, go to the Switches pane. In the following <module> and <port> must
	  be understood as the module numbers and io port numbers as explained above in the
	  naming paragraph.
	  Edit each of the new switches to add actions:
	  - For IHC inputs, add this in the "On Action" field:
	           script://IHCRemoteScriptActivateInput <module> <port>
	    and this in the "Off Action" fiels:
		       script://IHCRemoteScriptDeactivateInput.sh <module> <port>
	  - For IHC outputs, add this in the "On Action" field:
	           script://IHCRemoteScriptActivate.sh <module> <port>
	    and this in the "Off Action" fiels:
		       script://IHCRemoteScriptDeactivate.sh <module> <port>

4. Configure IHCServer to send updates to Domoticz:
	- On the machine, where IHCServer is running: Open /etc/ihcserver.cfg
	  and change the line 
			"domoticzServer" : "",
	  so that it contains the name or address of your DomoticzServer, such as
	        "domoticzServer" : "192.177.1.99:8080",

5. Restart IHCServer, so that it starts up with the new configuration and so that it
   can discover all the dummy switches in Domoticz.
